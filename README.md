# Data-Cleaning
Cleaning data is an important aspect of every machine learning study.

In tabular data, you may look at your data using a range of statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to see if there are any data cleaning tasks that need to be done.
Even seasoned machine learning practitioners sometimes neglect these basic steps, yet they are so critical that if they are ignored, models may break or produce unduly optimistic performance results.
1. How to identify and delete single-valued column variables.
2. Recognize and investigate column variables having a limited number of different values.
3. How to identify and delete duplicate observations in a row.


Here I am providing some data base which alredy use during the data cleaning. There are totale 4 dataset.



['X_train.csv', 'Y_train.csv', 'X_test.csv','Y_test.csv']
